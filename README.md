## WHAT
API-NASA or SPACE DISCOVERY is a website built to discover more about our universe and based on the NASA's APIS.
Project carried out individually on the basis of an existing project (Ast√© Astro). The goal is to develop a more aesthetic responsive and accessible design, to increase the number of APIs used and to work with libraries, particularly for the development of data visualization.

## HOW
In HTML and CSS, with a lot of Javascript and the Chart.js library for the data vizualisation.

## HO TO USE IT
The site is currently separated into 4 parts : an introduction, a part to know the astronomic picture of the day, a part to know the last weather on Mars and a part about asteroids (currently in progress). For the second part, you can enter the date of the picture you want to see, but for the third part, the datas are provided for the last 6 days.
I plan to develop it with a visualization of the nearest earth object (asteroids near the earth).
If you have some ideas, don't hesitate to send me your advices !
